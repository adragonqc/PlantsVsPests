NOTES FOR ARIELLA 

1. I could not use your makefile so I compiled 

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp map.cpp farmer.cpp pest.cpp plant.cpp  -I /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sfml/2.5.1_2/include/ -o prog -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sfml/2.5.1_2/lib/ -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio

My executable is called prog so I run this program ./prog

2. I didnot use strawberry .cpp or .h


3a. Main change for the segmentation fault was the Line 108 onwards main.cpp. First the i was not declared for the pest objects 

3b.  for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
            plants[i].update(dt); 

     some reason was not letting this loop go beyond 5. I checked your plant.h and the best fix was to limit the plants to 5 instead of 10. You can modify this. 


4. Pest.cpp and Pest.h
the pest constructor did not have the same number of parameters so I fixed that to fix the error. 

5. Plant.cpp and Plant.h : how did I get the plant.png to show up 
 Plant(float x, float y, int healthPoints, sf::Texture& texture); 

 You used sf::Texture. Explanation is below 

 sf::Texture& texture is a reference to a sf::Texture object, meaning that any changes made to texture will affect the original sf::Texture object passed in.

On the other hand, sf::Texture texture is a copy of the sf::Texture object passed in, meaning that any changes made to texture will not affect the original sf::Texture object passed in.

So if you want to modify the original texture, you should use sf::Texture& texture. If you don't need to modify it, you can use const sf::Texture& texture to indicate that you won't be modifying it, which can be helpful for preventing accidental modifications.


Please be mindful of the code you are writing, it took me 2 hours to parse through it to understand what was happenning. You are implementing too many things in the same time. Not a good way of coding at all.
